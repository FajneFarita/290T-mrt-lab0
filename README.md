# Lab 0

This lab aims to get you up and running with the software packages we'll be using for this course's lab.

## Pre-reqs

You will need to install some software to run this lab. After doing these steps, you shouldn't need to install any software for the rest of the course! (Unless you want to, of course...)

- *Python 3*. In a terminal window, try typing =python3 --version=. If it reads some number > 3, you are good to go! If not, [[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/][install Python3.6 for your platform]].
- *Jupyter notebooks*. You can [[https://jupyter.org/install.html][download the notebook installer here]].
- *XGBoost*. You can follow the setup instructions [[https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html][on the XGBoost documentation]]. Clone the repository, build the source, and perform the steps in "Python package installation." (We can provide support on this during the first lab session).
- *sklearn* and *pandas*. You should be able to simply =pip3 install sklearn pandas=.

## Completing this lab

Simply open the Jupyter notebook in this repo and complete the instructions!
